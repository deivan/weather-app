# Test Task for Vue Developer position

Implement app for looking for the weather for the current location.

Page should contain:
• Input for entering city
• 6 popular hardcoded cities (Your city, Kyiv, Lviv, London, Los Angeles, New York) as buttons
• result for temperature in selected place by default empty, after searching showing something

After I successfully searched for the city which is not in the popular list add it on top and remove last one, store the popular list in local storage
Page should work on mobile and desktop browsers. Styling is on you but it should be nice :)

For weather API please research on any Open API service
Please use next technologies and libraries Vue.js, Axios, SCSS, any CSS framework (like Ant Design, Bootstrap, Tailwind or any)

Extra:
• make list of popular sities sortable with drag and drop
• for the popular list higlight the hottest with star icon (highlights are visible after I searched for that city, do not search for them without user interaction)
• handle API or connection failure with messages or popups or whatever of you choice
